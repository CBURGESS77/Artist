		  Hello!  My name is Carlos Burgess.  I'm an artist located in Virginia Beach, VA.  I've basically been drawing all my life. 
 I haven't done any exhibitions or showcased my work at any art galleries (too shy I guess). However,  I'm setting up this site to
		show you some of my art work and my cartoon strips to which I'm having a lot of fun working
	        on.  I don't have much formal art training because I was too busy serving in the Army,
                and working as a technician at the CDC when I was living in Atlanta.  I'm also currently
                dealing with chronic kidney failure to which can be a drag.  However, you can read more about
                that in my cartoon blog page.  Thanks for coming to my site and enjoy!
